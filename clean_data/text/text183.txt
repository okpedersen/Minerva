there was once a sorcerer who was standing in the midst of a great crowd of people performing his wonders . he had a cock brought in , which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if it were light as a feather . but a girl was present who had just found a four-leaved clover , and had thus become so wise that no deception could stand out against her , and she saw that the beam was nothing but a straw . so she cried , you people , do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is carrying , and no beam . immediately the enchantment vanished , and the people saw what it was , and drove the magician away in shame and disgrace . he , however , full of inward anger , said , i will soon revenge myself . after some time the girl's wedding-day came , and she was decked out , and went in a great procession over the fields to the place where the church was . all at once she came to a stream which was very much swollen , and there was no bridge and no plank to cross it . then the bride nimbly took her clothes up , and wanted to wade through it . and just as she was thus standing in the water , a man , and it was the sorcerer , cried mockingly close beside her , aha . where are your eyes that you take that for water . then her eyes were opened , and she saw that she was standing with her clothes lifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the flowers of blue flax . then all the people saw it likewise , and chased her away with ridicule and laughter .
