in the time of schlauraffen i went forth and saw rome and the lateran hanging by a small silken thread , and a man without feet who outran a swift horse , and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge . i saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two fleet hares , and a lime-tree that was very large , on which hot cakes were growing . i saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body , and sixty loads of salt . have i not told enough lies . i saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow , and a child of one year threw four millstones from ratisbon to treves , and from treves to strasburg , and a hawk swam over the rhine , which he had a perfect right to do . i heard some fishes begin to make such a disturbance with each other , that it resounded as far as heaven , and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep valley to the top of a high mountain , and these were strange things . there were two crows which were mowing a meadow , and i saw two gnats building a bridge , and two doves tore a wolf to pieces , two children brought forth two kids , and two frogs threshed corn together . i saw two mice consecrating a bishop , and two cats scratching out a bear's tongue . then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions . there stood a barber and shaved a woman's beard off , and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue . there i saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the water , and a broken-down old horse was beside it , and said it was right . and four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn with all their might , and two goats were heating the stove , and a red cow shot the bread into the oven . then a hen crowed , cock-a-doodle-doo . the story is all told , cock-a-doodle-doo .
