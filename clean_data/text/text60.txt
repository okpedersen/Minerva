a little brother and sister were once playing by a well , and while they were thus playing , they both fell in . a water-nixie lived down below , who said , now i have got you , now you shall work hard for me , and carried them off with her . she gave the girl dirty tangled flax to spin , and she had to fetch water in a bucket with a hole in it , and the boy had to hew down a tree with a blunt axe , and they got nothing to eat but dumplings as hard as stones . then at last the children became so impatient , that they waited until one sunday , when the nixie was at church , and ran away . but when church was over , the nixie saw that the birds were flown , and followed them with great strides . the children saw her from afar , and the girl threw a brush behind her which formed an immense hill of bristles , with thousands and thousands of spikes , over which the nixie was forced to scramble with great difficulty , at last , however , she got over . when the children saw this , the boy threw behind him a comb which made a great ridge with a thousand times a thousand teeth , but the nixie managed to keep herself steady on them , and at last crossed over . then the girl threw behind her a looking-glass which formed a hill of mirrors , and was so slippery that it was impossible for the nixie to cross it . then she thought , i will go home quickly and fetch my axe , and cut the hill of glass in half . long before she returned , however , and had hewn through the glass , the children had escaped to a great distance , and the water-nixie was obliged to trundle back to her well again .
