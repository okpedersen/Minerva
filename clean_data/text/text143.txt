there was once a poor woman who had two children . the youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood . once when she had gone a long way to seek it , a little child , who was quite strong , came and helped her industriously to pick up the wood and carry it home , and then before a moment had passed the strange child disappeared . the child told her mother this , but at first she would not believe it . at length she brought a rose home , and told her mother that the beautiful child had given her this rose , and had told her that when it was in full bloom , he would return . the mother put the rose in water . one morning her child could not get out of bed . the mother went to the bed and found her dead , but she lay looking very happy . on the same morning , the rose was in full bloom .
