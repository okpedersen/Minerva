a countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen . when he got to the field , both the animals , horns began to grow , and went on growing , and when he wanted to go home they were so big that the oxen could not get through the gateway . by good luck a butcher came by just then , and he delivered them over to him , and made the bargain in this way , that he should bring the butcher a peck of rape-seed , and then the butcher was to count him out a brabant taler for every seed . i call that well sold . the peasant now went home , and carried the peck of rape-seed to him on his back . on the way , however , he lost one seed out of the bag . the butcher paid him justly as agreed on , and if the peasant had not lost the seed , he would have had one taler more . by the time he returned , the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky . then thought the peasant , as you have the chance , you must just see what the angels are doing up there above . so he climbed up , and saw that the angels above were threshing oats , and he looked on . while he was thus watching them , he observed that the tree on which he was standing , was beginning to totter . he peeped down , and saw that someone was just going to cut it down . if i were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing , thought he , and in his extremity he did not know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the oats which lay there in heaps , and twisting a rope of it . he likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven , and let himself down by the rope . but he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep , deep hole . so it was a real stroke of luck that he had brought the hoe , for he hoed himself a flight of steps with it , and mounted up , and took the flail with him as a token of his truth , so that no one could have any doubt of his story .
