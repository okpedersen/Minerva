there was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive , and when her parents told her to do anything , she did not obey them , so how could she fare well . one day she said to her parents , i have heard so much of frau trude , i will go to her some day . people say that everything about her does look so strange , and that there are such odd things in her house , that i have become quite curious . her parents absolutely forbade her , and said , frau trude is a bad woman , who does wicked things , and if you go to her , you are no longer our child . but the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parents , prohibition , and still went to frau trude . and when she got to her , frau trude said , why are you so pale . ah , she replied , and her whole body trembled , i have been so terrified at what i have seen . what have you seen . i saw a black man on your steps . that was a collier . then i saw a green man . that was a huntsman . after that i saw a blood-red man . that was a butcher . ah , frau trude , i was terrified . i looked through the window and saw not you , but , as i verily believe , the devil himself with a head of fire . oho . said she , then you have seen the witch in her proper costume . i have been waiting for you , and wanting you a long time already . you shall give me some light . then she changed the girl into a block of wood , and threw it into the fire . and when it was in a full blaze she sat down close to it , and warmed herself by it , and said , that shines bright for once in a way .
