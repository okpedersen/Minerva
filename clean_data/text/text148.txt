one afternoon the christ-child had laid himself in his cradle-bed and had fallen asleep . then his mother came to him , looked at him full of gladness , and said , have you laid yourself down to sleep , my child . sleep sweetly , and in the meantime , i will go into the wood , and fetch you a handful of strawberries , for i know that you will be pleased with them when you awake . in the wood outside , she found a spot with the most beautiful strawberries , but as she was stooping to gather one , an adder sprang up out of the grass . she was alarmed , left the strawberries where they were , and hastened away . the adder darted after her , but our lady , as you can readily understand , knew what it was best to do . she hid herself behind a hazel-bush , and stood there until the adder had crept away again . then she gathered the strawberries , and as she set out on her way home she said , as the hazel-bush has been my protection this time , it shall in future protect others also . therefore , from the most remote times , a green hazel-branch has been the safest protection against adders , snakes , and everything else which creeps on the earth .
