a certain king had three sons who were all equally dear to him , and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death . when the time came when he was about to die , he summoned them to his bedside and said , dear children , i have been thinking of something which i will declare unto you , whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom . the eldest said , then , father , the kingdom is mine , for i am so idle that if i lie down to rest , and a drop falls in my eye , i will not open it that i may sleep . the second said , father , the kingdom belongs to me , for i am so idle that when i am sitting by the fire warming myself , i would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg . the third said , father , the kingdom is mine , for i am so idle that if i were going to be hanged , and had the rope already round my neck , and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which i might cut the rope , i would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope . when the father heard that , he said , you have carried it the farthest , and shall be king .
