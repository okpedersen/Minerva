the she-wolf brought into the world a young one , and invited the fox to be godfather . after all , he is a near relative of ours , said she , he has a good understanding , and much talent , he can instruct my little son , and help him forward in the world . the fox , too , appeared quite honest , and said , worthy mrs . gossip , i thank you for the honor which you are doing me , i will , however , conduct myself in such a way that you shall be repaid for it . he enjoyed himself at the feast , and made merry , afterwards he said , dear mrs . gossip , it is our duty to take care of the child , it must have good food that it may be strong . i know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel . the wolf was pleased with the idea , and she went out with the fox to the farmyard . he pointed out the fold from afar , and said , you will be able to creep in there without being seen , and in the meantime i will look about on the other side to see if i can pick up a chicken . he , however , did not go there , but sat down at the entrance to the forest , stretched his legs and rested . the she-wolf crept into the stable . a dog was lying there , and it made such a noise that the peasants came running out , caught gossip wolf , and poured a strong burning mixture , which had been prepared for washing , over her skin . at last she escaped , and dragged herself outside . there lay the fox , who pretended to be full of complaints , and said , ah , dear mrs . gossip , how ill i have fared , the peasants have fallen on me , and have broken every limb i have , if you do not want me to lie where i am and perish , you must carry me away . the she-wolf herself was only able to walk slowly , but she was in such concern about the fox that she took him on her back , and slowly carried him who was perfectly safe and sound to her house . then the fox cried to her , farewell , dear mrs . gossip , may the roasting you have had do you good , laughed heartily at her , and bounded off .
