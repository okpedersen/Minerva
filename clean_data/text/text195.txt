where do you like best to feed your flocks , said a man to an old cowherd . here , sir , where the grass is neither too rich nor too poor , or else it is no use . why not , asked the man . do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow there , answered the cowherd , that is the bittern . he was once a cowherd , and so was the hoopoe also , i will tell you the story . the bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where flowers grew in abundance , so his cows became wild and unmanageable . the hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills , where the wind plays with the sand , and his cows became thin , and got no strength . when it was evening , and the cowherds wanted to drive their cows homewards , the bittern could not get his together again . they were too high-spirited , and ran away from him . he called , come , cows , come , but it was of no use . they took no notice of his calling . the hoopoe , however , could not even get his cows up on their legs , so faint and weak had they become . up , up , up , screamed he , but it was in vain , they remained lying on the sand . that is the way when one has no moderation . and to this day , though they have no flocks now to watch , the bittern cries , come , cows , come , and the hoopoe , up , up , up .
