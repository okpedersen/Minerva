how fortunate is the master , and how well all goes in his house , when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them , but prefers following his own wisdom . a clever hans of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow . he stayed away a long time , and the master thought , faithful hans does not spare any pains over his work . but when he did not come back at all , the master was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him , and set out himself to look for him . he had to search a long time , but at last he caught sight of the boy running up and down a large field . now , dear hans , said the master when he had got up to him , have you found the cow which i sent you to seek . no , master , he answered , i have not found the cow , but then i have not looked for it . then what have you looked for , hans . three blackbirds , answered the boy . and where are they , asked the master . i see one of them , i hear the other , and i am running after the third , answered the wise boy . take example by this , do not trouble yourselves about your masters or their orders , but rather do what comes into your head and pleases you , and then you will act just as wisely as clever hans .
