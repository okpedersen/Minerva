it happened that the cat met the fox in a forest , and as she thought to herself , he is clever and full of experience , and much esteemed in the world , she spoke to him in a friendly way . good-day , dear mr . fox , how are you . how is all with you . how are you getting on in these hard times . the fox , full of all kinds of arrogance , looked at the cat from head to foot , and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not . at last he said , oh , you wretched beard-cleaner , you piebald fool , you hungry mouse-hunter , what can you be thinking of . have you the cheek to ask how i am getting on . what have you learnt . how many arts do you understand . i understand but one , replied the cat , modestly . what art is that , asked the fox . when the hounds are following me , i can spring into a tree and save myself . is that all , said the fox . i am master of a hundred arts , and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning . you make me sorry for you . come with me , i will teach you how people get away from the hounds . just then came a hunter with four dogs . the cat sprang nimbly up a tree , and sat down on top of it , where the branches and foliage quite concealed her . open your sack , mr . fox , open your sack , cried the cat to him , but the dogs had already seized him , and were holding him fast . ah , mr . fox , cried the cat . you with your hundred arts are left in the lurch . had you been able to climb like me , you would not have lost your life .
