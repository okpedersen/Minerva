george one day said to his little chickens , come into the parlor and enjoy yourselves , and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table . your mistress has gone out to pay some visits . then the chickens said , no , no , we will not go . if the mistress gets to know it , she will beat us . george said , she will know nothing about it . so come . after all , she never gives you anything good . then the chickens again said , nay , nay , we must let it alone . we must not go . but george let them have no peace until at last they went , and got on the table , and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might . but at that very moment the mistress came , and seized the stick in great haste , and beat them and treated them very harshly . and when they were outside the house , the chickens said to george , do , do , do , do , do , you see . then george laughed and said , didn't , didn't , didn't , i expect it . so they just had to run away .
