the fox once came to a meadow in which sat a flock of fine fat geese , on which he smiled and said , i come in the nick of time , you are sitting together quite beautifully , so that i can eat you up one after the other . the geese cackled with terror , sprang up , and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives . but the fox would listen to nothing , and said , there is no mercy to be had . you must die . at length one of them took heart and said , if we poor geese are to yield up our lives , show us the only possible favor and allow us one more prayer , that we may not die in our sins , and then we will place ourselves in a row , so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest . yes , said the fox , that is reasonable , and a pious request . pray away , i will wait till you are done . then the first began a good long prayer , for ever saying , ga , ga , and as she would make no end , the second did not wait until her turn came , but began also , ga , ga . the third and fourth followed her , and soon they were all cackling together . when they have done praying , the story shall be continued further , but at present they are still praying unceasingly .
