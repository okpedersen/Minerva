the lord god had created all animals , and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog , but he had forgotten the goat . then the devil made ready and began to create also , and created goats with fine long tails . now when they went to pasture , they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails , whereupon the devil had to go and disentangle them , with a great deal of trouble . this enraged him at last , and he went and bit off the tail of every goat , as may be seen to this day by the stump . then he let them go to pasture alone , but it came to pass that the lord god perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree , at another injured the noble vines , or destroyed other tender plants . this distressed him , so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves , who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there . when the devil observed this , he went before the lord and said , your creatures have destroyed mine . the lord answered , why did you create things to do harm . the devil said , i was compelled to do it , inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil . what i create can have no other nature , and you must pay me heavy damages . i will pay you as soon as the oak leaves fall , come then , your money will then be ready counted out . when the oak-leaves had fallen , the devil came and demanded what was due to him . but the lord said , in the church of constantinople stands a tall oaktree which still has all its leaves . with raging and curses , the devil departed , and went to seek the oak , wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it , and when he returned , all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves . then he had to forfeit his indemnity , and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats , and put his own in instead . this is why all goats have devil's eyes , and their tails bitten off , and why he likes to assume their shape .
