there was once upon a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead , and she was so poor that she no longer had a room to live in , or bed to sleep in , and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her . she was good and pious , however . and as she was thus forsaken by all the world , she went forth into the open country , trusting in the good god . then a poor man met her , who said , ah , give me something to eat , i am so hungry . she handed him the whole of her piece of bread , and said , may god bless you , and went onwards . then came a child who moaned and said , my head is so cold , give me something to cover it with . so she took off her hood and gave it to him . and when she had walked a little farther , she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold . then she gave it her own , and a little farther on one begged for a frock , and she gave away that also . at length she got into a forest and it had already become dark , and there came yet another child , and asked for a shirt , and the good little girl thought to herself , it is a dark night and no one sees you , you can very well give your shirt away , and took it off , and gave away that also . and as she so stood , and had not one single thing left , suddenly some stars from heaven fell down , and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money , and although she had just given her shirt away , she had a new one which was of the very finest linen . then she put the money into it , and was rich all the days of her life .
