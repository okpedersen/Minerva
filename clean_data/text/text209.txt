in the winter time , when deep snow lay on the ground , a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood . when he had gathered it together , and packed it , he wished , as he was so frozen with cold , not to go home at once , but to light a fire and warm himself a little . so he scraped away the snow , and as he was thus clearing the ground , he found a tiny golden key . hereupon he thought that where the key was , the lock must be also , and dug in the ground and found an iron chest . " if the key does but fit it ! " thought he ; " no doubt there are precious things in that little box . " he searched , but no keyhole was there . at last he discovered one , but so small that it was hardly visible . he tried it , and the key fitted it exactly . then he turned it once round , and now we must wait until he has quite unlocked it and opened the lid , and then we shall learn what wonderful things were lying in that box .
