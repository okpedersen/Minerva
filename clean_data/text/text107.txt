a girl from brakel once went to st . anne's chapel at the foot of the hinnenberg , and as she wanted to have a husband , and thought there was no one else in the chapel , she sang , oh , holy saint anne . help me soon to a man . thou know'st him right well , by suttmer gate does he dwell , his hair it is yellow , thou know'st him right well . the clerk , however , was standing behind the altar and heard that , so he cried in a very gruff voice , you shall not have him . you shall not have him . the maiden thought that the child mary who stood by her mother anne had called out that to her , and was angry , and cried , fiddle de dee , conceited thing , hold your tongue , and let your mother speak .
