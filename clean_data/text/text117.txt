there was once upon a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question . the king of the country heard of it likewise , but did not believe it , and sent for the boy . then he said to him , if you can give me an answer to three questions which i will ask you , i will look on you as my own child , and you shall dwell with me in my royal palace . the boy said , what are the three questions . the king said , the first is , how many drops of water are there in the ocean . the shepherd boy answered , lord king , if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until i have counted it , i will tell you how many drops there are in the sea . the king said , the next question is , how many stars are there in the sky . the shepherd boy said , give me a great sheet of white paper , and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen , and it was all but impossible to count them , any one who looked at them would have lost his sight . then he said , there are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper . just count them . but no one was able to do it . the king said , the third question is , how many seconds of time are there in eternity . then said the shepherd boy , in lower pomerania is the diamond mountain , which is two miles high , two miles wide , and two miles deep . every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it , and when the whole mountain is worn away by this , then the first second of eternity will be over . the king said , you have answered the three questions like a wise man , and shall henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace , and i will regard you as my own child .
