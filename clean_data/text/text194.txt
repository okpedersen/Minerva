the fishes had for a long time been discontented because no order prevailed in their kingdom . none of them turned aside for the others , but all swam to the right or the left as they fancied , or darted between those who wanted to stay together , or got into their way . and a strong one gave a weak one a blow with its tail , which drove it away , or else swallowed it up without more ado . how delightful it would be , said they , if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us , and they met together to choose for their ruler the one who could cleave through the water most quickly , and give help to the weak ones . they placed themselves in rank and file by the shore , and the pike gave the signal with his tail , on which they all started . like an arrow , the pike darted away , and with him the herring , the gudgeon , the perch , the carp , and all the rest of them . even the sole swam with them , and hoped to win the race . all at once , the cry was heard , the herring is first , the herring is first . who is first , screamed angrily the flat envious sole , who had been left far behind , who is first . the herring , the herring , was the answer . the naked herring , cried the jealous creature , the naked herring . since that time the sole has been punished by having been given a mouth on one side .
