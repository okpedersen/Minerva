there was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old , who was so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without liking him , and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world . now it so happened that he suddenly became ill , and god took him to himself , and for this the mother could not be comforted and wept both day and night . but soon afterwards , when the child had been buried , it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life , and if the mother wept , it wept also , and when morning came it disappeared . but as the mother would not stop crying , it came one night , in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin , and with its wreath of flowers round its head , and stood on the bed at her feet , and said , " oh , mother , do stop crying , or i shall never fall asleep in my coffin , for my shroud will not dry because of all your tears , which fall upon it . " the mother was afraid when she heard that , and wept no more . the next night the child came again , and held a little light in its hand , and said , " look , mother , my shroud is nearly dry , and i can rest in my grave . " then the mother gave her sorrow into god's keeping , and bore it quietly and patiently , and the child came no more , but slept in its little bed beneath the earth .
