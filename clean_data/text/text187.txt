i will tell you something . i saw two roasted fowls flying , they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell , and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the rhine prettily , slowly , and gently , and a frog sat on the ice at whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare . three fellows who wanted to catch a hare , went on crutches and stilts , one of them was deaf , the second blind , the third dumb , and the fourth could not stir a step . do you want to know how it was done . first , the blind man saw the hare running across the field , the dumb one called to the lame one , and the lame one seized it by the neck . there were certain men who wished to sail on dry land , and they set their sails in the wind , and sailed away over great fields . then they sailed over a high mountain , and there they were miserably drowned . a crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed , and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there . in that country the flies are as big as the goats are here . open the window that the lies may fly out .
