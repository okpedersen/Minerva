there was once an old woman , but you have surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now . this woman begged likewise , and when she got anything she said , may god reward you . the beggar-woman came to a door , and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself . the boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door , come , old mother , and warm yourself . she came in , but stood too near the fire , so that her old rags began to burn , and she was not aware of it . the boy stood and saw that , but he ought to have put the flames out . is it not true that he ought to have put them out . and if he had not any water , then he should have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes , and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them .
