there were once upon a time two sisters , one of whom had no children and was rich , and the other had five and was a widow , and so poor that she no longer had food enough to satisfy herself and her children . in her need , therefore , she went to her sister , and said , my children and i are suffering the greatest hunger . you are rich , give me a mouthful of bread . the very rich sister was as hard as a stone , and said , i myself have nothing in the house , and drove away the poor creature with harsh words . after some time the husband of the rich sister came home , and was just going to cut himself a piece of bread , but when he made the first cut into the loaf , out flowed red blood . when the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred . he hurried away to help the widow and her children , but when he entered her room , he found her praying . she had her two youngest children in her arms , and the three eldest were lying dead . he offered her food , but she answered , for earthly food have we no longer any desire . god has already satisfied the hunger of three of us , and he will hearken to our supplications likewise . scarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones drew their last breath , whereupon her heart broke , and she sank down dead .
