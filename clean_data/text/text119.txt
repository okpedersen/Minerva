a father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children , and a good friend who had come on a visit ate with them . and as they thus sat , and it was striking twelve o'clock , the stranger saw the door open , and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in . it did not look around , and it did not speak , but went straight into the next room . soon afterwards it came back , and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner . on the second and on the third day , it came also exactly in the same way . at last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged . i have never seen it , said he , neither did he know to whom it could belong . the next day when it again came , the stranger pointed it out to the father , who however did not see it , and the mother and the children also all saw nothing . at this the stranger got up , went to the room door , opened it a little , and peeped in . then he saw the child sitting on the ground , and busily digging and seeking about between the boards of the floor , but when it saw the stranger , it disappeared . he now told what he had seen and described the child exactly , and the mother recognized it , and said , ah , it is my dear child who died a month ago . they took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man . it , however , had thought , you can buy yourself a biscuit for that , and had kept the farthings , and hidden them in the openings between the boards . and therefore it had had no rest in its grave , and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings . the parents gave the money at once to a poor man , and after that the child was never seen again .
