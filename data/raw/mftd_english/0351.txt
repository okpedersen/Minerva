The churl that wants another's fareDeserves at least to lose his share.As through the stream a Dog convey'dA piece of meat, he spied his shadeIn the clear mirror of the flood,And thinking it was flesh and blood,Snapp'd to deprive him of the treat:-But mark the glutton's self-defeat,Miss'd both another's and his own,Both shade and substance, beef and bone.
