He, that malicious men relieves,His folly in a season grieves.A Man, against himself humane,Took up an Adder, that had lainAnd stiffen'd in the frosty air,And in his bosom placed with care,Where she with speed recovering breath,Her benefactor stung to death.Another Adder near the place,On asking why she was so base,Was told, " 'Tis others to dissuadeFrom giving wickedness their aid."
