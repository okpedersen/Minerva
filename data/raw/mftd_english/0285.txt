A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. Hecalled out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holdingout a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scoldedthe boy for his imprudence. "Oh, sir!" cried the youth, "prayhelp me now and scold me afterwards." Counsel without help is useless.
