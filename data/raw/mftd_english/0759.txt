Once upon a time there was a little mouse who, coming out of his hole, met an enormous lion.
The lion wanted to eat him up.
“Please, Mr. Lion, don’t eat me. One day you might need me.”
The lion answered, “Why should I need someone as small as you?”
Seeing how tiny the mouse was, the lion took pity on him and set him free.
One day, the mouse heard an almight roar.
It was the lion.
When he got to the place, he found the lion trapped in a net.
“I’ll save you!” said the mouse.
“You?” You are too small for such a hard task.”
The mouse started to nibble at the rope of the net and the lion was saved.
From that day on they were friends forever.
