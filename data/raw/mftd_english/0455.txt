The reason of those best able to have their way is always the best:
We now show how this is true.
A lamb was quenching its thirst
In the water of a pure stream. 
A fasting wolf came by, looking for something; 
He was attracted by hunger to this place. 
—What makes you so bold as to meddle with my drinking? 
Said this animal, very angry. 
You will be punished for your boldness. 
—Sir, answered the lamb, let Your Majesty 
Not put himself into a rage; 
But rather, let him consider 
That I am taking a drink of water 
In the stream 
More than twenty steps below him; 
And that, consequently, in no way, 
Am I troubling his supply. 
—You do trouble it, answered the cruel beast. 
And I know you said bad things of me last year. 
—How could I do that when I wasn't born, 
Answered the lamb; I am still at my mother's breast. 
—If it wasn't you, then it was your brother. 
—I haven't a brother.—It was then someone close to you; 
For you have no sympathy for me, 
You, your shepherds and your dogs. 
I have been told of this.I have to make things even. 
Saying this, into the woods 
The wolf carries the lamb, and then eats him 
Without any other why or wherefore.
