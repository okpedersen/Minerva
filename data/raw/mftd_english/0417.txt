His folly in repentance ends,Who, to a flatt'ring knave attends.A Crow, her hanger to appease,Had from a window stolen some cheese,And sitting on a lofty pineIn state, was just about to dine.This, when a Fox observed below,He thus harangued the foolish Crow:" Lady, how beauteous to the viewThose glossy plumes of sable hue!Thy features how divinely fair!With what a shape, and what an air!Could you but frame your voice to sing,You'd have no rival on the wing.'But she, now willing to displayHer talents in the vocal way,Let go the cheese of luscious taste,Which Renard seized with greedy haste.The grudging dupe now sees at lastThat for her folly she must fast.
