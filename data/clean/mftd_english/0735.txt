When I have noticed how man acts at times , and how , in a thousand ways , he comports himself just as the lower animals do , I have often said to myself that the lord of these lower orders has no fewer faults than his subjects . Nature has allowed every living thing a drop or two from the fount at which the spirits of all creatures imbibe . I will prove what I say . If at the hour when night has scarcely passed and day hardly begun I climb into a tree , on the edge of some wood , and , like a new Jupiter from the heights of Olympus , I send a shot at some unsuspecting rabbit , then the whole colony of rabbits , who were enjoying their thyme-scented meal with open eyes and listening ears upon the heath , immediately scamper away . The report sends them all to seek refuge in their subterranean city . But their great fright is soon over ; the danger quickly forgotten . Again I see the rabbits more light-hearted than ever coming close under my death-dealing hand . Does not this give us a picture of mankind ? Dispersed by some storm , men no sooner reach a haven than they are ready again to risk the same winds and the same distress . True rabbits , they run again into the death-dealing hands of fortune . Let us add to this example another of a more ordinary kind . When strange dogs pass through any spot beyond their customary route there is a grand to-do . I leave you to picture it . All the dogs of the district with one idea in their heads join forces , barking and biting , to chase the intruder beyond the bounds of their territory . So , it may be , a similar joint-interest in property or in glory and grandeur leads such people as the governors of states , certain favoured courtiers , and people of a trade to behave exactly like these jealous dogs . All of us , as a rule , rob the chance-comer and tear him to pieces . Vain ladies and men of letters are usually so disposed . Woe betide the newly-arrived beauty or a new writer ! As few as possible fighting round the cake ! That's the best way ! I could bring a hundred examples to bear upon this subject ; but the shorter a discourse is the better . I take the masters of literature for my model in this and hold that in the best of themes something should be left unsaid for the reader to consider about . Therefore this discourse shall end .
