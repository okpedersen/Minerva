YOU must know that this ditty . This little romance , Be it dull , be it witty . Arose from mere chance . Near a certain enclosure . Not far from my manse , An Ass with composure Was browsing by chance . As he went along prying . With sober advance , A shepherd's Flute lying He found there by chance . Our amateur started , And eyed it askance . Drew nearer and snorted Upon it by chance . The breath of the brute . Sir , Drew music for once ; It entered the Flute , Sir , And blew it by chance . " Ah ! " cried he in wonder , " How comes this to pass ? Who will now dare to slander The skill of an Ass ? " And Asses in plenty , I see at a glance Will , one time in twenty . Succeed by mere chance .
