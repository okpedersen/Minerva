Our destiny is frequently met in the very paths we take to avoid it . A father had an only son whom he loved excessively . His devoted affection caused him to be so anxious as to the boy ' s welfare that he sought to learn from astrologers and fortune - tellers what fate was in store for the son and heir . One of these soothsayers told him that an especial danger lay with lions , from which the youth must be guarded until the age of twenty was reached , but not after . The father , to make sure of this precaution , upon the issue of which depended the life of his loved one , commanded that by no chance should the boy ever be permitted to go beyond the threshold of the house . Ample provision was made for the satisfaction of all the wishes proper to youth in the way of play with his companions , jumping , running , walking , and so forth . As the age approached when the spirits of youth yearn for the chase , he was taught to hold that sport in abhorrence . But temperament cannot be changed by persuasion and counsel , nor by enlightenment . The young man , eager , ardent , and full of courage , no sooner felt the promptings of his years than he sighed for the forbidden pleasures . The greater the hindrance the stronger the desire . Knowing the reason of his galling restrictions , and viewing day by day in his palatial home the hunting scenes pictured in paint and tapestry on every wall , his excitement became unrestrained . Once his eye fell upon a pictured lion . " Ah ! Monster ! " he exclaimed in a transport of indignation . " It is to you that the shade and fetters in which I live are due ! " With that he struck the lion ' s form a heavy blow with his fist . Hidden under the tapestry a great nail offered its cruel point , and upon this his hand was impaled . The wound grew beyond the reach of medical skill , and in the end this life , so guarded and cherished , was lost by means of the very care taken to preserve it . The same jealous precaution proved fatal to the poet Æschylus . It is said that some fortune - teller menaced him with the fall of a house as his doom , upon which he at once left the town and made his bed in the open fields , far from roofs and beneath the sky . But an eagle flew by overhead carrying in its talons a tortoise , and seeing the bald head of the poet beneath , which it mistook for a stone , the bird let fall its prey in order to break the shell of the tortoise . Thus were the days of poor Æschylus ended . From these two examples it would seem that this art of fortune - telling , if there be any truth in it , causes one to fall into the very evil one would be in dread of when one consulted it . But I will demonstrate and maintain that the art is false . I do not believe that Nature would have tied her own hands , and ours also , to the extent of marking our fate in the heavens . For our fate depends upon certain combinations of time , place , and people ; not upon the combinations of charlatans . A shepherd and a king are born under the same planet : one carries the sceptre ; the other the crook . The planet Jupiter willed it so ! But what is this planet Jupiter ? A body without senses . Whence comes it then that its influence works so differently on these two men ? Further , how could its influence , if it had any , penetrate through endless voids to our world ?
