That great hero - wanderer Ulysses had been with his companions driven hither and thither at the will of the winds for ten years , never knowing what their ultimate fate was to be . At length they disembarked upon a shore where Circe , the daughter of Apollo , held her court . Receiving them she brewed a delicious but baneful liquor , which she made them drink . The result of this was that first they lost their reason , and a few moments after , their bodies took the forms and features of various animals ; some unwieldy , some small . Ulysses alone , having the wisdom to withstand the temptation of the treacherous cup , escaped the metamorphosis . He , besides possessing wisdom , bore the look of a hero and had the gift of honeyed speech , so that it came about that the goddess herself imbibed a poison little different from her own ; that is to say , she became enamoured of the hero and declared her love to him . Now was the time for Ulysses to profit by this turn of events , and he was too cunning to miss the opportunity , so he begged and obtained the boon that his friends should be restored to their natural shapes . " But will they be willing to accept their own forms again ? " asked the nymph . " Go to them and make them the offer . " Ulysses , glad and eager , ran to his Greeks and cried , " The poisoned cup has its remedy , and I come to offer it to you . Dear friends of mine , will you not be glad to have your manly forms again ? Speak , for your speech is already restored . " The lion was the first to reply . Making an effort to roar he said , " I , for one , am not such a fool . What ! renounce all the great advantages that have just been given me ? I have teeth . I have claws . I can pull to pieces anything that attacks me . I am , in fact , a king . Do you think it would suit me to become a citizen of Ithaca once more ? Who knows but that you might make of me a common soldier again . Thank you ; but I will remain as I am . " Ulysses , in sad surprise , turned to the bear . " Ah , brother ! what form is this you have taken , you who used to be so handsome ? " " Well , really ! I like that ! " said the bear in his way . " What form is this ? you ask . Why it is the form that a bear should have . Pray who instructed you that one form is more handsome than another ? Is it your business to judge between us ? I prefer to appeal to the sight of the gentler sex in our ursine race . Do I displease you ? Then pass on . Go your ways and leave me to mine . I am free and content as I am , and I tell you frankly and flatly that I will not change my state . " The princely Greek then turned to a wolf with the same proposals , and risking a similar rebuff said : " Comrade , it overwhelms me that a sweet young shepherdess should be driven to complain to the echoing crags of the gluttonous appetite that impelled you to devour her sheep . Time was when you would have protected her sheepfold . In those days you led an honest life . Leave your lairs and become , instead of a wolf , an honest man again . " " What is that ? " answered the wolf . " I don ' t see your point . You come here treating me as though I were a carnivorous beast . But what are you , who are talking in this strain ? Would not you and yours have eaten these sheep , which all the village is deploring , if I had not ? Now say , on your oath , do you really think I should have loved slaughter any less if I had remained a man ? For a mere word , you men are at times ready to strangle each other . Are you not , therefore , as wolves one to another ? All things considered , I maintain as a matter of fact that , rascal for rascal , it is better to be a wolf than a man . I decline to make any change in my condition . " In this way did Ulysses go from one to another making the same representations and receiving from all , large and small alike , the same refusals . Liberty , unbridled lust of appetite , the ambushes of the woods , all these things were their supreme delight . They all renounced the glory attaching to great deeds . They thought that in following their passions they were enjoying freedom , not seeing that they were but slaves to themselves .
