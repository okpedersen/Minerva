There was once a cobbler who was so light hearted that he sang from morning to night . It was wonderful to watch him at his work , and more wonderful still to hear his runs and trills . He was in fact happier than the Seven Sages . This merry soul had a neighbour who was exactly the reverse . He sang little and slept less ; for he was a financier , and made of money , as they say . Whenever it happened that after a sleepless night he would doze off in the early morning , the cobbler , who was always up betimes , would wake him up again with his joyful songs . " Ha ! " thought the man of wealth , " what a misfortune it is that one cannot buy sleep in the open market as one buys food and drink ! " Then an idea came to him . He invited the cobbler to his house , where he asked him some questions . " Tell me , Master Gregory , what do you suppose your earnings amount to in a year ? " " In a year , " laughed the cobbler , " that ' s more than I know . I never keep accounts that way , nor even keep one day from another . So long as I can make both ends meet , that ' s good enough for me ! " " Really ! " replied the financier . " But what can you earn in one day ? " " Oh , sometimes more and sometimes less . The mischief of it is that there are so many fÃªte days and high - days and fast - days crowded into the year , on which , as the priest tells us , it is wicked to work at all ; and worse still he keeps on finding some new saint or other to give weight to his sermons . If it were not for that , cobbling would be a fine paying game . " At this the wealthy man laughed . " Look here , my friend , to - day I ' ll lift you to the seats of the mighty ! Here is a hundred pounds . Guard them and use them with care . " When the cobbler held the bag of money in his hand he imagined that it must be as much as would be coined in a hundred years . Returning home he buried the cash in his cellar . Alas ! he buried his joy with it , for there were no more songs . From the moment he came into possession of this wealth , the love of which is the root of all evil , his voice left him , and not only his voice , but his sleep also . And in place of these came anxiety , suspicion , and alarms ; guests which abode with him constantly . All day he kept his eye on the cellar door . Did a cat make a noise in the night , then for a certainty that cat was after his money . At last , in despair , the wretched cobbler ran to the financier whom he now no longer kept awake . " Oh , give me back my joy in life , my songs , my sleep ; and take your hundred pounds again . "
