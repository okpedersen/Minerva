A Hog under a mighty Oak Had glutted tons of tasty acorns , then , supine , Napped in its shade ; but when awoke , He , with persistence and the snoot of real swine , The giant's roots began to undermine . " The tree is hurt when they're exposed , " A Raven on a branch arose . " It may dry up and perish - don't you care ? " " Not in the least ! " The Hog raised up its head . " Why would the prospect make me scared ? The tree is useless ; be it dead Two hundred fifty years , I won't regret a second . Nutritious acorns - only that's what's reckoned ! " - " Ungrateful pig ! " The tree exclaimed with scorn . " Had you been fit to turn your mug around You'd have a chance to figure out Where your beloved fruit is born . "
