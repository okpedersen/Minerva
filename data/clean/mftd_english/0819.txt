I would like to miraculously be in Ispahan this evening . " The good prince lends his horses . In the afternoon , the prince meets Death . " Why , he asks him , did you , this morning make a threatening gesture to my gardiner ? " " I did not make a threatening gesture " , he replies , " but a gesture of surprise . Because I saw him far from Ispahan this morning and I must take him in Ispahan this evening . "
