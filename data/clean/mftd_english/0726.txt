Once upon a time there were two dogs , one named Lurcher and the other Cæsar . They were brothers ; handsome , well-built , and plucky , and descended from dogs who were famous in their day . These two brothers , falling into the hands of different masters , found their destinies likewise in different spheres ; for whilst one haunted the forests , the other lurched about a kitchen . The names to which they now answered were not , however , the names that were first given them . The influence of each one's career upon his nature brought about a new name and a new reputation ; for Cæsar's nature was improved and strengthened by the life he led , whilst Lurcher's was made more and more despicable by a degraded existence . A scullion named him Lurcher ; but the other dog received his noble name on account of his life of high adventure . He had held many a stag at bay , killed many a hare , and otherwise risen to the position of a Cæsar among dogs . Care was taken that he should not mate indiscriminately , so that his descendants' blood should not degenerate . On the other hand , poor Lurcher bestowed his affections wherever he would and his brood became populous . He was the progenitor of all turn-spits in France ; a variety which became common enough to form at last a race in themselves . They show more readiness to flee than to attack , and are the very antipodes of the Cæsars . We do not always follow our ancestors , nor even resemble our fathers . Want of care , the flight of time , a thousand things , cause us to degenerate . Ah ! how many , Cæsars , failing to cultivate their best nature and their gifts , become Lurchers !
