A PIGEON , oppressed by excessive thirst , saw a goblet of water painted on a signboard . Not supposing it to be only a picture , she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard , jarring herself terribly . Having broken her wings by the blow , she fell to the ground , and was caught by one of the bystanders . Zeal should not outrun discretion .
