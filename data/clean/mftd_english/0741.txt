Everything to do with love is mystery . Cupid ' s arrows , his quiver , his torch , his boyhood : it is more than a day ' s work to exhaust this science . I make no pretence here of explaining everything . My object is merely to relate to you , in my own way , how the blind little god was deprived of his sight , and what consequences followed this evil which perchance was a blessing after all . On the latter point I will decide nothing , but will leave it to lovers to judge upon . One day as Folly and Love were playing together , before the boy had lost his vision , a dispute arose . To settle this matter Love wished to lay his cause before a council of the gods ; but Folly , losing her patience , dealt him a furious blow upon the brow . From that moment and for ever the light of heaven was gone from his eyes . Venus demanded redress and revenge , the mother and the wife in her asserting themselves in a way which I leave you to imagine . She deafened the gods with her cries , appealing to Jupiter , Nemesis , the judges from Hades , in fact all who would be importuned . She represented the seriousness of the case , pointing out that her son could now not make a step without a stick . No punishment , she urged , was heavy enough for so dire a crime , and she demanded that the damage should be repaired . When the gods had each well considered the public interest on the one hand and the complainant ' s demands upon the other , the supreme court gave as its verdict that Folly was condemned for ever more to serve as a guide for the footsteps of Love .
