A woodcutter had broken or lost the handle of his hatchet and found it not easy to get it repaired at once . During the time , therefore , that it was out of use , the woods enjoyed a respite from further damage . At last the man came humbly and begged of the forest to allow him gently to take just one branch wherewith to make him a new haft , and promised that then he would go elsewhere to ply his trade and get his living . That would leave unthreatened many an oak and many a fir that now won universal respect on account of its age and beauty . The innocent forest acquiesced and furnished him with a new handle . This he fixed to his blade and , as soon as it was finished , fell at once upon the trees , despoiling his benefactress , the forest , of her most cherished ornaments . There was no end to her bewailings : her own gift had caused her grief . Here you see the way of the world and of those who follow it . They use the benefit against the benefactors . I weary of talking about it . Yet who would not complain that sweet and shady spots should suffer such outrage . Alas ! it is useless to cry out and be thought a nuisance : ingratitude and abuses will remain the fashion none the less .
