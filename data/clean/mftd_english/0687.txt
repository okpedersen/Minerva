BY thirst incited ; to the brook The Wolf and Lamb themselves betook . The Wolf high up the current drank , The Lamb far lower down the bank . Then , bent his ravenous maw to cram , The Wolf took umbrage at the Lamb . " How dare you trouble all the flood , And mingle my good drink with mud ? " " Sir , " says the Lambkin , sore afraid , " How should I act , as you upbraid ? The thing you mention cannot be , The stream descends from you to me . " Abash'd by facts , says he , " I know 'Tis now exact six months ago You strove my honest fame to blot " - " Six months ago , sir , I was not . " " Then 'twas th' old ram thy sire , " he cried , And so he tore him , till he died . To those this fable I address Who are determined to oppress , And trump up any false pretence , But they will injure innocence .
