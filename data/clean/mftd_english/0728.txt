What God does is done well . Without going round the world to seek a proof of that , I can find one in the pumpkin . A villager was once struck with the largeness of a pumpkin and the thinness of the stem upon which it grew . " What could the Almighty have been thinking about ? " he cried . " He has certainly chosen a bad place for a pumpkin to grow . Eh zounds ! Now I would have hung it on one of these oaks . That would have been just as it should be . Like fruit , like tree ! What a pity , Hodge , " said he , addressing himself , " that you were not on the spot to give advice at the Creation which the parson preaches about . Everything would have been properly done then . For instance ; wouldn't this acorn , no bigger than my little finger , be better hanging on this frail stem ? The Almighty has blundered there surely ! The more I think about these fruits and their situations , the more it seems to me that it is all a mistake . " Becoming worried by so much reflection our Hodge cast himself under an oak saying , " A man can't sleep when he has so much brain . " Then he at once dropped off into a nap . Presently an acorn fell plump upon his nose . Starting from sleep , he put his hand up to see what had happened and found the acorn caught in his beard , whilst his nose began to pain and bleed . " Oh , oh ! " he cried , " I am bleeding . How would it have been if a heavier mass than this had fallen from the tree : if this acorn had been a pumpkin ? The Almighty did not intend that , I see . Doubtless he was right . I understand the reason why perfectly now . " So praising God for all things Hodge took his way home .
