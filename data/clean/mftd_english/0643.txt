AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose - Tree , thus addressed it : " What a lovely flower is the Rose , a favorite alike with Gods and with men . I envy you your beauty and your perfume . " The Rose replied , " I indeed , dear Amaranth , flourish but for a brief season ! If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem , yet I must perish by an early doom . But thou art immortal and dost never fade , but bloomest for ever in renewed youth . "
