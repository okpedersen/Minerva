" What have I done to be treated in this way ? Mutilated by my own master ! A nice state to be in ! Dare I present myself before other dogs ? O ye kings over the animals , or rather tyrants of them , would any creature do the same to you ? " Such were the lamentations of poor Fido , a young house-dog , whilst those who were busy cropping his ears remained quite untouched by his piercing and dolorous howls . Fido believed himself to be ruined for life ; but he very shortly found that he was a gainer by the maiming . For being by nature disposed to pilfer from his companions , it would come within his experience to have many misadventures wherein his ears would be torn in a hundred places . Aggressive dogs always have ragged ears . The less they have for other dogs' teeth to fasten upon the better . When one has but a single weak place to defend , one protects it against an onset . Witness Master Fido armed with a spiked collar , and having no more ears to catch hold of than are on my hand . Even a wolf would not have known where to take him .
