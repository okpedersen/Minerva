Bertrand was a monkey and Ratter was a cat . They shared the same dwelling and had the same master , and a pretty mischievous pair they were . It was impossible to intimidate them . If anything was missed or spoilt , no one thought of blaming the other people in the house . Bertrand stole all he could lay his hands upon , and as for Ratter , he gave more attention to cheese than he did to the mice . One day , in the chimney corner , these two rascals sat watching some chestnuts that were roasting before the fire . How jolly it would be to steal them they thought : doubly desirable , for it would not only be joy to themselves , but an annoyance to others . " Brother , " said Bertrand to Ratter , " this day you shall achieve your master - stroke : you shall snatch some chestnuts out of the fire for me . Providence has not fitted me for that sort of game . If it had , I assure you chestnuts would have a fine time . " No sooner said than done . Ratter delicately stirred the cinders with his paw , stretched out his claws two or three times to prepare for the stroke , and then adroitly whipped out first one , then two , then three of the chestnuts , whilst Bertrand crunched them up between his teeth . In came a servant , and there was an end of the business . Farewell , ye rogues ! I am told that Ratter was by no means satisfied with the affair . And princes are equally dissatisfied when , flattered to be employed in any uncomfortable concern , they burn their fingers in a distant province for the profit of some king .
