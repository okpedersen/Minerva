Three saints , all equally zealous and anxious for their salvation , had the same ideal , although the means by which they strove towards it were different . But as all roads lead to Rome , these three were each content to choose their own path . One , touched by the cares , the tediousness , and the reverses which seem to be inevitably attached to lawsuits , offered , without any reward , to judge and settle all causes submitted to him . To make a fortune on this earth was not an end he had in view . Ever since there have been laws , man , for his sins , has condemned himself to litigation half his lifetime . Half ? three-quarters , I should say , and sometimes the whole . This good conciliator imagined he could cure the silly and detestable craze for going to law . The second saint chose the hospitals as his field of labour . I admire him . Kindly care taken to alleviate the sufferings of mankind is a charity I prefer before all others . The sick of those days were much as they are now—peevish , impatient , and ever grumbling . They gave our poor hospitaller plenty of work . They would say , " Ah ! he cares very particularly for such and such . They are his friends , hence we are neglected . " But bad as were these complaints they were nothing to those which the arbiter had to face . He got himself into a sorry tangle . No one was content . Arbitration pleased neither one side nor the other . According to them the judge could never succeed in holding the balance level . No wonder that at last the self-appointed judge grew weary . He betook himself to the hospitals . There he found that the self-sacrificing hospitaller had nothing better to tell of his results . Complaints and murmurs were all that either could gain . With sad hearts they gave up their endeavours and repaired to the silent wood , there to live down their sorrows . In these retreats , at a spot sheltered from the sun , gently tended by the breezes , and near a pure rivulet , they found the third saint , and of him they asked advice . " Advice , " said he , " is only to be sought of yourselves ; for who , better than yourselves , can know your own needs ? The knowledge of oneself is the first care imposed upon mankind by the Almighty . Have you obeyed this mandate whilst out in the world ? If there you did not learn to know yourselves , these tranquil shades will certainly help you ; for nowhere else is it possible . Stir up this stream . Do you now see yourselves reflected in it ? No ! How could you , when the mud is like a thick cloud between us and the crystal ? But let it settle , my brothers , and then you will see your image . The better to study yourselves live in the desert . " The lonely hermit was believed and the others followed his wise counsel . It does not follow that people should not be well employed . Since some must plead ; since men die and fall ill , doctors are a necessity and so also are lawyers . These ministers , thank God , will never fail us . The wealth and honours to be won make one sure of that . Nevertheless , in these general needs one is apt to neglect oneself . And you , judges , ministers , and princes , who give all your time to the public weal ; you , who are troubled by countless annoyances and disappointments , disheartened by failure and corrupted by good fortune—you do not see yourselves . You see no one . Should some good impulse lead you to think over these matters , some flatterer breaks in and distracts you . This lesson is the ending of this work . May the centuries to come find it a useful one . I present it to kings . I propose it to the wise . What better ending could I make ?
