How I have always hated the opinions of the mob ! To me , a mob seems profane , unjust , and rash , putting false construction on all things , and judging every matter by a mob - made standard . Democritus had experience of this . His countrymen thought him mad . Little minds ! But then , no one is a prophet in his own country ! The people themselves were mad , of course , and Democritus was the wise man . Nevertheless the error went so far that the city of Abdera [ 6 ] sent a messenger to the great physician Hippocrates , requesting him both by letter and by spoken word to come and restore the sage ' s reason . " Our citizen , " said the spokesman with tears in his eyes , " has lost his wits , alas ! Study has corrupted Democritus . If he were less wise we should esteem him much more . He will have it that there is no limit to the number of worlds like ours and that possibly they are inhabited with numberless Democrituses . Not satisfied with these wild dreams , he talks also of atomsâ€”phantoms born only in his own empty brain . Then , measuring the very heavens , though he remains here below to do it , he claims to know the universe ; yet admits that he does not know himself . Time was when he could control debates , now he mutters only to himself . So come , thou divine mortal , for the patient ' s case is a bad one . " Hippocrates , though he had little faith in these people , went nevertheless . Now mark , I beg of you , what strange meetings fate may bring about in this life ! Hippocrates arrived just at the time when this man , who was supposed to have neither sense nor reason , happened to be searching into a question as to whether this very reason was seated in the heart or in the head of men and beasts . Sitting in leafy shade , beside a brook , and with many a volume at his feet , he was occupied wholly with a study of the convolutions of the brain ; and thus absorbed , as his manner was , he scarcely noticed the advance of his friend the learned physician . Their greeting was soon over as you may imagine , for the sage is at all times chary of time and speech . So having put aside mere trifles of conversation , they reasoned upon man and his mind , and next fell to talking upon ethics . It is not necessary that I should here enlarge upon what each had to say to the other on these matters . The little tale suffices to show that we may rightly take exception to the judgments of the mob . That being so , in what sense is it true , as I have read in a certain passage , that the voice of the people is the voice of God ? [ 6 ] A city on the shores of Thracia .
