Like many others in the world , there was an ass . He was going along a ravine , laden with Malaga wine . ( You know that asses are very much afraid of wolves , because the wolves are very fond of the flesh of asses . ) While he was journeying along in that fashion , he sees a wolf coming at some distance ; he could not hide himself anywhere . The wolf comes up , and the ass says to him : " Good morning , good morning , Mr . Wolf ; in case you should be thirsty , I have some excellent Malaga to drink . " " I am not thirsty ; no ! - - but astoundingly hungry ; yes ! My dinner to - day shall be your head and ears . " " Mr . Wolf , if you were good enough to let me go and hear one mass - - - - - - ? " He says to him , " Well ! yes . " Our ass goes off then . When he gets into the church he shuts the door inside with his foot , and stops quietly there . When the wolf began to get impatient at waiting , he said : " Ay , ay , what a long mass ! one would say it was Palm Sunday . " The ass said to him : " Dirty old wolf , have patience . I am staying here with the angels , and I have my life ( safe ) for to - night . " " Ay , ay , you bad ass , you are too , too , filthy , you know . If ever you meet with me again , mass you shall not hear . " The ass said to him : " There are no dogs round the fold of Alagaia ; if you go there you would get lots of sheep . " The wolf gives it up , and sets off for the flock where the ass had told him to go . When the ass saw that he had gone away he came out of the church , and went home , and took good care not to come near the wolf ' s place any more .
