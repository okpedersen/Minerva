There was a funeral . The dead body was progressing sadly towards its last resting place ; and following rather gladly , was the priest who meant to bury it as soon as possible . The dead man , in a leaden coffin , was borne in a coach , and was properly shrouded in that robe the dead always wear be it summer or winter . As for the priest , he sat near it , intoning as hard as he could all sorts of orisons , psalms , lessons , verses , and responses , in the hope that the more he gave the more would be paid for . " Leave it to me , Mr . Deadman , " his actions seemed to say . " I ' ll give you a nice selection ; a little of everything . It ' s only a matter of fees , you know . " And the Rev . John Crow kept his eye on his silent charge as if he expected some one would make off with it . " Mr . Deadman , " his looks proclaimed , " by you I shall receive so and so much in money , so and so much in wax candles , and , possibly , a little more in incidental profits . On the strength of these calculations he promised himself a quarter - cask of the best wine the neighbourhood could offer . Beyond that he settled that a certain very attractive niece of his , as well as his housekeeper Paquette , should both have new dresses . Whilst these pleasant and generous thoughts were running in his mind there came a terrific shock . The car overturned . The Rev . John Crow ' s head was broken by the coffin which fell upon him . Alas for the poor priest ! he went to heaven with the parishioner he thought only to bury . In reality , life over and over again is nothing but the fate of the Rev . John Crow who counted on his dead , and of Perrette who counted on her chickens .
