Some young turkeys were lucky enough to find a tree which served them as a citadel against the assaults of a certain fox . He , one night , having made the round of the rampart and seen each turkey watching like a sentinel , exclaimed , " What ! These people laugh at me , do they ? And do they think that they alone are exempt from the common rule ? No ! by all the gods ! no ! " He accomplished his design . The moon shining brilliantly seemed to favour the turkey folk against the fox . But he was no novice in the laying of sieges , and had recourse to his bag of rascally tricks . He pretended to climb the tree ; stood upon his hind legs ; counterfeited death ; then came to life again . Harlequin himself could not have acted so many parts . He reared his tail and made it gleam in the moonshine , and practised a hundred other pleasantries , during which no turkey could have dared to go to sleep . The enemy tired them out at last by keeping their eyes fixed upon him . The poor birds became dazed . One lost its balance and fell . Reynard put it by . Then another fell and was caught and laid on one side . Nearly half of them at length succumbed and were taken off to the fox ' s larder . To concentrate too much attention upon a danger may cause us to tumble into it .
