A TORTOISE , lazily basking in the sun , complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate , that no one would teach her to fly . An Eagle , hovering near , heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air . " I will give you , " she said , " all the riches of the Red Sea . " " I will teach you to fly then , " said the Eagle ; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go , and she fell on a lofty mountain , dashing her shell to pieces . The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death : " I have deserved my present fate ; for what had I to do with wings and clouds , who can with difficulty move about on the earth ? ' If men had all they wished , they would be often ruined .
