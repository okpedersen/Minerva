One of those dread evils which spread terror far and wide , and which Heaven , in its anger , ordains for the punishment of wickedness upon earth—a plague in fact ; and so dire a one as to make rich in one day that grim ferryman who takes a coin from all who cross the river Acheron to the land of the dead—such a plague was once waging war against the animals . All were attacked , although all did not die . So hopeless was the case that not one of them attempted to sustain their sinking lives . Even the sight of food did not rouse them . Wolves and foxes no longer turned eager and calculating eyes upon their gentle and guileless prey . The turtle - doves went no more in cooing pairs , but were content to avoid each other . Love and the joy that comes of love were both at an end . At length the lion called a council of all the beasts and addressed them in these words : " My dear friends , it seems to me that it is for our sins that Heaven has permitted this misfortune to fall upon us . Would it not be well if the most blameworthy among us allowed himself to be offered as a sacrifice to appease the celestial wrath ? By so doing he might secure our recovery . History tells us that this course is usually pursued in such cases as ours . Let us look into our consciences without self - deception or condoning . For my own part , I freely admit that in order to satisfy my gluttony I have devoured an appalling number of sheep ; and yet what had they done to me to deserve such a fate ? Nothing that could be called an offence . Sometimes , indeed , I have gone so far as to eat the shepherd too ! On the whole , I think I had better render myself for this act of sacrifice ; that is , if we agree that it is a thing necessary to the general good . And yet I think it would be only fair that every one should declare his sins as well as I ; for I could wish that , in justice , it were the most culpable that should perish . " " Sire , " said the fox , " you are really too yielding for a king , and your scruples show too much delicacy of feeling . Eating sheep indeed ! What of that ? —a foolish and rascally tribe ! Is that a crime ? No ! a hundred times no ! On the contrary your noble jaws did but do them great honour . As for the shepherd , it may be fairly said that all the harm he got he merited , since he was one of those who fancy they have dominion over the animal kingdom . " Thus spake the fox and every other flatterer in the assembly applauded him . Nor did any seek to inquire deeply into the least pardonable offences of the tiger , the bear , and the other mighty ones . All those of an aggressive nature , right down to the simple watch - dog , were something like saints in their own opinions . When the ass stood forth in his turn he struck a different note : nothing of fangs and talons and blood . " I remember , " he said , " that once in passing a field belonging to a monastery I was urged by hunger , by opportunity , by the tenderness of the grass , and perhaps by the evil one egging me on , to enter and crop just a taste , about as much as the length of my tongue . I know that I did wrong , having really no right there . " At these words all the assembly turned upon him . The wolf took upon himself to make a speech proving without doubt that the ass was an accursed wretch , a mangy brute , who certainly ought to be told off for sacrifice , since through his wickedness all their misfortunes had come about . His peccadillo was judged to be a hanging matter . " What ! eat the grass belonging to another ? How abominable a crime ! Nothing but death could expiate such an outrage ! " And forthwith they proved as much to the poor ass . Accordingly as your power is great or small , the judgments of a court will whiten or blacken your reputation .
