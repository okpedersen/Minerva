Who does not run after Fortune ? I would I were in some spot whence I could watch the eager crowds rushing from kingdom to kingdom in their vain chase after the daughter of Chance ! They are indeed but faithful followers of a phantom ; for when they think they have her , lo ! she is gone ! Poor wretches ! One must pity rather than blame their foolishness . " That man , " they say with sanguine voice , " raised cabbages ; and now he is Pope ! Are we not as good as he ? " Ah ! yes ! a hundred times as good perhaps ; but what of that ? Fortune has no eyes for all your merit . Besides , is Papacy , after all , worth peace , which one must leave behind for it ? Peace—a treasure that once was the possession of gods alone—is seldom granted to the votaries of Dame Fortune . Do not seek her ; and then she will seek you . That is the way with women ! There once were two friends , who lived comfortably and prospered moderately in a village ; but one of them was always wishing to do better . One day he said to the other , " Suppose we left this place and tried our luck elsewhere ? You know that a prophet is never received in his own country ! " " You try , by all means , " returned his friend , " but as for me , I am contented where I am . I desire neither better climate nor better possibilities . You please yourself . Follow your unquiet spirit . You ' ll soon return , and I shall sleep soundly enough awaiting you . " So the man of ambition , or the money - grubber , whichever you like to call him , took to the road , and arrived next day at a place where , if anywhere , Dame Fortune should be found , namely , the court . He stayed at court for some long time , never missing an opportunity to put himself in the way of favours . He was in evidence when the king went to bed , when he arose , and on all other propitious occasions . " What ' s amiss ? " he said at last . " Fortune , I am convinced , dwells here ; for I have seen her the guest now of this one and now of that one . How is it that I cannot entertain the capricious creature ? I must try her elsewhere . I have already been told that the people of this place are exceedingly ambitious . Evidently there is no room for me here . So , adieu ! gentleman of the court , and follow to the bitter end this will - o ' - the - wisp ! They tell me that Dame Fortune has temples in Surat . Very well ! We will go there . " He embarked at once . What hearts of bronze have humankind ! The man who first attempted this awful route and defied its terrors must have had a heart of adamant . Often did our traveller turn his eyes towards his little home as first pirates , then contrary winds , then calms , then rocks—all agents of death—in turn assailed him . Strange it is that men should take such pains to meet death , since it will come only too quickly to them in their homes ! Our adventurer arrived in India . There they told him that Japan was the place where Fortune dispensed her favours . He hurried there . The sea wearied of carrying him about . In the end all the profit his long voyages brought him was the lesson which he learnt from savages , and that was : " Stop in your own country and let Nature instruct you . " Japan , India , or anywhere else ; no one place was better than another as a hunting ground for Fortune ; so the conclusion was forced upon him that he had been wiser had he stayed in his own village . At last he renounced all these ungrateful wanderings and returned to his own country ; and as he caught sight of his homestead from afar he wept for joy , and cried : " Happy is the man who , staying in his home , finds constant occupation in adjusting his desires to his surroundings . To him the court , the sea , and the land of Fortune are but hearsay . Thou , fickle Dame , flaunting before our eyes dignities and wealth , dost cause us to follow after these allurements to the ends of the earth , only to find them empty shams . Henceforth I wander no more , for here at home a hundred times more success shall I find . " Having registered this vow against Fortune the wanderer came to the door of his friend , and lo ! there sat Fortune , waiting on the threshold , whilst his friend slumbered within .
