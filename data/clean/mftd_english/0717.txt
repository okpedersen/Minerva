A young country woman named Perrette set out one morning from her little dairy - farm with a pail of milk which she cleverly balanced upon her head over a pad or cushion . She hurried with sprightly steps to the market town , and so that she might be the less encumbered , wore a kirtle that was short and light—in truth a simple petticoat—and shoes low and easy . As she went , her thoughts ran upon the price to be gained for her milk , and she schemed a way to lay out the sum in the purchase of one hundred eggs . She was sure that with care and diligence these would yield three broods . " It would be quite easy to me , " she said , " to raise the chicks near the house . The fox would be clever who would not leave me enough to buy one pig . A pig would fatten at the cost of a little bran , and when he had grown a fair size I should make a bargain of him for a good round sum . And then , considering the price he will fetch , what is to prevent my putting into our stable a cow and a calf ? I can fancy how the calf will frisk about among the sheep ! " Thereupon Perrette herself frisked for joy , transported with the picture of her affluence . Over toppled the milk ! Adieu to calf and cow and pig and broods ! This lady of wealth had to leave , with tearful eyes , her dissipated fortunes , and go straight to her husband framing excuses to avoid a beating . Overtoppled the milk . The farce became known to the whole countryside , and people called Perrette by the name of " Milkpail " ever after . Who has never talked wildly ? Who has never built castles in Spain ? Wise men as well as milkmaids ; sages and fools , all have waking dreams and find them sweet ! Our senses are carried away by some flattering falsehood , and then wealth , honours , and beauty seem ours to command . Alone with my thoughts I challenge the bravest . I dethrone monarchs and the people rejoicing crown me instead , showering diadems upon my head . Then lo ! a little accident happens to bring me back to my senses , and I am Poor Jack as before .
