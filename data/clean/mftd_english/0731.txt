One day two pilgrims espied upon the sands of the shore an oyster that had been thrown up by the tide . They devoured it with their eyes whilst pointing at it with their fingers ; but whose teeth should deal with it was a matter of dispute . When one stopped to pick up the prey the other pushed him away saying : " It would be just as well first to decide which of us is to have the pleasure of it . He who first saw it should swallow it , and let the other watch him eat . " " If you settle the affair that way , " replied his companion , " I have good eyes , thank God . " " But my sight is not bad either , " said the other , " and I saw it before you did , and that I ' ll stake my life upon . " " Well , suppose you did see it , I smelt it . " During this lively interlude Justice Nincompoop arrived on the scene , and to him they appealed to judge their claims . The justice very gravely took the oyster , opened it , and put it into his mouth , whilst the two claimants looked on . Having deliberately swallowed the oyster , the justice , in the portentous tones of a Lord Chief Justice , said , " The court here awards each of you a shell , without costs . Let each go home peaceably . " Reckon what it costs to go to law in these days . Then count what remains to most families . You will see that Justice Nincompoop draws all the money and leaves only the empty purse and the shells to the litigants . Deliberately swallowed the oyster .
