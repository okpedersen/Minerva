There is an ape in Paris to whom a wife was once given ; and he , imitating many another husband , beat the poor creature to such an extent that she sighed all the breath out of her body and died . Their son uttered the most doleful howls as a protest to this terrible business . The father laughs now . His wife is dead and he already has found other lady companions , whom , no doubt , he beats in the same way ; for he haunts the taverns and is frequently tipsy . Never expect anything good from people who imitate , whether they be apes or authors . Of the two the worst kind is the imitating author .
