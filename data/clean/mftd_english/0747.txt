There was once a mouse who lived in terrible fear of a cat that had lain in wait watching for her . She was in great anxiety to know what she could do to escape the threatening danger . Being prudent and wise she consulted her neighbour , a large and important rat . His lordship the rat had taken up his abode in a very good inn , and had boasted a hundred times that he had no fear for either tom - cat or she - cat . Neither teeth nor claws caused him any anxious thought . " Dame Mouse , " said this boaster , " whatever I do , I cannot , upon my word , chase away this cat that threatens you without some help . But let me call together all the rats hereabouts and I ' ll play him a sorry trick or two . " The mouse curtsied humbly her thanks and the rat ran with speed to the head - quarters ; that is to say to the larder , where the rats were in the habit of assembling . Arriving out of breath and perturbed in mind he found them making a great feast at the expense of their host . " What ails you ? " asked one of the feasters . " Speak ! " " In two words , " answered he , " the reason for my coming among you in this way is simply that it has become absolutely necessary to help the mice ; for Grimalkin is abroad making terrible slaughter among them . This , the most devilish of cats , will , when she has no mice left , turn her attention to the eating of rats . " " He says what is true , " cried they all . " To arms , to arms ! " Nothing could stem the tide of their impetuosity ; although , it is said , a few she - rats shed tears . It was no matter . Every one overhauled his equipment , and filled his wallet with cheese . To risk life was the determination of all . They set off , as if to a fÃªte , with happy minds and joyful hearts . Alas , for the mouse ! These warriors were a moment too late . The cat had her already by the head . Advancing at the double the rats ran to the succour of their good little friend ; but the cat swore , and stalked away in front of the enemy , having no intention of surrendering her prey . At the sound of the cat ' s defiance , the prudent rats , fearing ill fate , beat a safe retreat without carrying any further their intended onslaught . Each one ran to his hole , and whenever any ventured out again it was always with the utmost caution to avoid the cat .
